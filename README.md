RFID IN THE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT: TO INVESTIGATE  THE POSSIBILITY OF RFID AND BIOMETRICS BASED AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM FOR  ENSURING SECURE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT


Since passwords are easily forgotten, lost, and discovered using password cracking software, they have now begun to be seen as an insecure method of personal authentication and a weakness in the security of many computer systems. Therefore, more and more organisations and individuals are considering RFID and biometric as the technology that will increase security.
0.1	Problem Statement
RFID Radio Frequency Identification is made up of an antenna, a transceiver, and a transponder. The antenna transmits a signal using radio frequency waves to activate the transponder.  The transponder then transmits data back to the antenna. This data tells the programmable logic controller that some kind of action needs to take place, such as raising an access gate, or to access a database to perform a monetary transaction. The transponder is known as the tag and most of them are not battery powered but are powered with the initial radio signal to transmit their response. RFID tags are microchips that are very small. For example, 0.3 millimeters square in size (RFID Journal, 2003), and continuously listens for a radio query. When it responds it transmits its unique ID code. RFID does not need a straight-line-of-sight or direct contact for scanning purposes. (Webopedia, 2005) The RFID signal can be short range or long range. RFID is used widely for the stock control, tracking of goods in the retail sector, and implanted in livestock and domestic pets.

Biometrics uses equipment and software to recognise human features such as face, fingerprints, hand geometry, handwriting, iris, retinal, vein, voice and personal behavior that is said to uniquely identify an individual. 

For biometric data to be use has an effective form of authentication, there are certain properties that the information gathered from biometrics should consist of which are; measurable in a short period of time, remain unchanged for a long period of time (Invariance), unique from one individual to another, the information capturing technique must be acceptable to the majority of the public, the data captured must be able to be stored in a small amount of space, so that it is easy to manipulate, the data capturing process and the data itself must be reliable and reproducible, the privacy of an individual must be maintained. (Br√ºderlin 2001)

0.2	Description of Problem 
The problem to be solved is to prove that it is possible to use biometrics and RFID as a method of personal authentication during the process of an electronic payment.

A user of the Biometric and RFID authentication technologies should be provided the technology in an easily portable form such as a card. This card should allow them to make payments in shops, over the Internet and whilst using the telephone.

The reason for considering biometrics and RFID as a method for personal authentication is because of the increase in the impersonation of individuals through; credit card thefts, personal information thrown out in domestic household garbage, access to computer data and access to restricted areas.
